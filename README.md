# ENCORE (Enhancing Nuclear Cybersecurity for Optimization and Resilience Education)

## Introduction

This tool has been created as part of a MSci Computing Science research project designed to interweave traditional knowledge-based nuclear cybersecurity training with a serious game, aiming to enhance phishing awareness for employees and practitioners.

## Getting Started

Once the repository has been cloned, the dependencies must be installed to run the tool locally. This can be done using the command `npm i` once in the `/encore` directory.
